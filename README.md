## Description 
  This projects is about fixing some already written code on a note taking application. I used express mainly to be the middle man between the front end and the back end. I used GET and POST aspects of api's to retrieve notes written before and new notes to be written. When deployed using Heroku i can acces the notes anywhere.

## Installation 
  Clone the repo onto your computer. Inside of the directory run (npm i) to install the necessary dependicies then  (npm start). The program will then run from your machine on http://localhost:3001. Another alternative to running this program is to head to the link (https://secret-fortress-47602.herokuapp.com/notes) where the program runs on Heroku.
## Usage 
  This could be used as a simple to do reminder or personal note taking app. I really dont see the commercial aspect of it but it does serve the purpose of holding information of what you desire personally from anywhere in the world that you can access.
## Contributing 
  No contributions necessary at this moment.
## Tests 
  Explore around in the code and checkout the databse in the (db) directory where each note is stored. Try to add security mesures like adding a passcode to private some notes. Let me know what you find.
